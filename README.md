## Summary
* The busiest starting and ending locations are between Midtown and the Financial District. Taking this in context with most users being male subscribers, trips being short in duration, and the peak rental hours being 8-9am and 5-7pm, it is likely that most users are locals who live in this area and rent going to and coming form work.

* More analysis is needed to determine the feasibility of a bike sharing company in Des Moines, Iowa.

* Some additional analysis' that would be suggested would be to determine the population's relative proximity of home location to places of work in Des Moines. Additionally, to determine the tourism data of Des Moines compared to New York. New York is a high density city whereas Des Moines may not be. This could potentially affect the the ride duration and therefore feaseablility of biking as a mode of transporation.
